# Code of Conduct

ContainerSSH aims to be a welcoming community for everyone to talk about and develop this open source tool. We kindly ask you to follow these four simple rules:

1. Be nice to each other.
2. Assume good intentions.
3. Attack the idea not the person.
4. Please take politics and off-topic discussions elsewhere.

It sometimes happens that our words don't read like we intend them to, especially online. However, we do not tolerate rude behavior of any kind on our platforms. In such a case our moderators will gently remind the person in question to be kind to each other. On repeated violations we will ask the person in question to leave our community.

If you witness such behavior, or you are personally attacked please refrain from answering if possible and contact our staff at handshake@containerssh.io.
